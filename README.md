# toSystemD

If you work with NodeJS projects and prefer to run them on a Linux box using SystemD as the process manager. Then this small project will help you save a lot of time by creating the `.service` file for you, based on the content of the `package.json` file and the location in which the CLI was executed.

# How to run

Run the `tosystemd` command in the directory where you project is located, and if all the necessary data is present in the `package.json` file, the tool will

- generate a .service file which will be saved in the right systemD directory.
- Then it will force systemD to reload the service files.
- it will the start your server.
- finally it will tell systemD to start your server every time the system boots.

# Example .service file

```
[Unit]
Description=example.com
Documentation=https://github.com/user/example.com
After=network.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/home/admin/example.com/.env
Type=simple
User=admin
Group=admin
WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/example.com
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node bin/server
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=example.com
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
KillMode=process
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once complete this app will let you know if the process was successful or not.

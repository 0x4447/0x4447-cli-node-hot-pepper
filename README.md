# toSystemD

If you work with NodeJS projects and prefer to run them on a Linux box using SystemD as the process manager. Then this small project will help you save time by creating the .service file for you based on the content of the `package.json` file and the location in which the CLI was executed.

# How to run

Run the `tosystemd` command in the directory where you project is located, and in the end you'll get a new file with the correct SystemD configuration, for example:

```
[Unit]
Description=example.com
Documentation=https://github.com/user/example.com
After=network.target

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/home/admin/example.com/.env
Type=simple
User=admin
Group=admin
WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/example.com/david.gatti.pl
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node bin/server
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=example.com
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
KillMode=process
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This App will also output all the commands that you need to run to make the service working.
